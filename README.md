## üîé Overview of EPINET-Lite

**EPINET-Lite: Rethinking Mixed Convolutions for Efficient Light Field Disparity Estimation**  

Light field disparity estimation with CNNs often suffers from **high computational cost**, mainly due to large convolutional kernels. While small kernels are efficient, they may fail to capture broader spatial-angular context.  

This work introduces **EPINET-Lite**, a lightweight yet accurate network that integrates an **Optimized Mixed Convolution (MixConv+)** operation into the EPINET architecture. Unlike conventional mixed convolutions that split channels into fixed groups, MixConv+ applies **pointwise + depthwise convolutions in parallel with multiple kernel sizes**, allowing the network to learn multi-scale features more effectively.  

### üöÄ Key Contributions
- **Analysis of convolution operations:** Studied standard, depthwise separable, inverted bottleneck, and mixed convolutions across different kernel sizes.  
- **MixConv+:** Proposed an optimized mixed convolution that improves efficiency while capturing features across multiple receptive fields.  
- **Efficiency:** Achieves up to **4.2√ó reduction in model complexity** compared to standard convolutions.  
- **Performance:** Demonstrates **improved disparity estimation performance** on the HCI light field benchmark while using **fewer parameters** and maintaining fast inference.  

### üìä Results
- **76% reduction** in parameters compared to baseline EPINET.  
- Achieves **lowest mean square error (MSE)** among compared methods, while staying competitive on Bad Pixel Ratio metrics.  
- Produces sharper and more consistent disparity maps, even in challenging scenes (e.g., fine textures, occlusions).  

EPINET-Lite balances **accuracy and efficiency**, making it practical for **real-time applications** and deployment on **resource-constrained environments**.
